# Microsoft Certifications Revision/Study Guides

This is a home for revision/study guides for Microsoft Certifications. Each guide is primarily a collection of external links to web pages, blog articles, books etc; which people can use to prepare themselves for taking the exams.

There are some simple guidelines to consider when opening a PR to include new content: 

1. The content should be relevant.
   1. Ideally it should fit directly under one of the headings for a topic in that exam listed under 'Skills Measured' on the official Microsoft certification page.
   1. Content which doesn't fit under a 'Skills Measured' heading should be included under the guide's 'Other Useful Resources'.
1. Content additions should add something new which isn't sufficiently covered already.
1. All external resources should be in English (for now).
1. All media is relevant and different formats are good - podcasts and videos are as useful as blog posts and book recommendations!
1. Content should not break any [Microsoft certification exam policies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-exam-policies.aspx) (i.e. no 'brain dumps').
